Googlemap Plugin - v1.0

This plugin allows a developer to drop in a generic googlemap into any page very easily.
There are a number of default map settings, but they can be overwritten and added to depending on the map requirements.
You can set the center of the map, and a pin on the centre too.
There are options to have custom pins.
The markers are defined as an array of pins. 
Each pin object has a title, lat, lng, custom pin reference, and an infoWindow HTML string.
Implementation is as easy as:
			$(document).ready(function(){
				$("#mapPane").MapMe({
				    options: go here
				});				
			});


Custom Pin:
for each custom pin the setting can be turned off by using "false", 
required: lat and lng

if markerCluster is set to true, then the markers on the page will be clustered using the marker cluster script.
this script needs to be included in the HTML
these clusters can be styled using the markerClusterOptions object.

	'gridSize': (number) The grid size of a cluster in pixels.
  	'maxZoom': (number) The maximum zoom level that a marker can be part of a cluster.
  	'zoomOnClick': (boolean) Whether the default behaviour of clicking on a cluster is to zoom into it.
	'averageCenter': (boolean) Wether the center of each cluster should be the average of all markers in the cluster.
